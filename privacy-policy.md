Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 2024-05-15

This Privacy Policy explains how the Document Manager mobile application (the "App") handles user data. The primary purpose of our App is to allow you to manage your documents locally on your device.

1. Information We Collect

Our App does not directly collect any personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, location, etc.). All documents, notes, and tags you create or import within the App are stored solely on your device's local storage (IndexedDB). This data is not sent to any external servers or accessed by us.

2. How We Use Information

Any data we collect or process (your documents stored locally on your device) is used solely to perform the core functionalities of the App:

To organize, view, and manage your documents.
To allow you to add tags and descriptions to your documents.
To track versions of your documents.
To enable you to export or import your documents from/to your device.
3. Data Storage and Security

All your document data is stored in your device's local storage (IndexedDB). This means you retain full control over your data. However, this data is not encrypted within the App. The security of your device (e.g., device lock, encryption) is your responsibility. In the event of your device being lost, stolen, or subjected to unauthorized access, the security of your documents stored within the App may be at risk.

4. Third-Party Services

Our App may utilize the following third-party services:

AdMob (Google): Used for displaying advertisements within the App. AdMob may collect information related to your device (e.g., advertising ID) for ad personalization purposes. For more information on Google's AdMob Privacy Policy, please visit Google's website.
Capacitor Plugins: Used to access device features such as filesystem access, camera usage, and sharing. These plugins may process data necessary to perform the App's core functions (e.g., reading a file you select), but this data is not collected or stored by us.
5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

Our App does not share, sell, rent, or disclose your document data or personal information stored on your device with any third parties.

6. Data Retention

Documents you create or import within the App remain on your device until you delete the App from your device. When you uninstall the App, all your local data will also be deleted.

7. Disclaimers

Unencrypted Data Disclaimer: Document data stored within the App is not encrypted. The security of this data depends on the overall security of your device. It is solely your responsibility to ensure the security of your device. The App is not responsible for any damages that may arise from unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure of unencrypted data.
Document Loss Disclaimer: The App stores your documents locally on your device. The App is not responsible for the loss of your documents due to device malfunction, loss, theft, damage, or accidental deletion of the App. It is strongly recommended that you regularly back up your data (e.g., by using the export feature).
8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective upon posting within the App or on our website. We will notify you of any significant changes.
